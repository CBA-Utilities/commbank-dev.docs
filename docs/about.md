# About Us
We're the engine room that ensures our 5000+ engineers across the group can do their job, which is to produce world-class software that enriches the lives of millions of Australians every day.

What separates the best from the rest for me is a 'can-do' attitude. Your approach to work as well as life, and your eagerness to make a real difference, interests me more than the knowledge you walk through the door with.
