This is a **VSCode extension** built by the Cloud Engineering teams to facilitate a seamless transition to our Cloud environments.

## Configuration 🛠️

The extension works out of the box when using your standard CBA Engineering device.

If you wish to change the default keybinding, you can do it in your `Keyboard Shortcuts`:

1. Open **Command Palette**.
2. On Windows, press `Ctrl + Shift + P`. On macOS, press `Cmd + Shift + P`.
3. Search for `Open Keyboard Shortcuts` and search for the `CBA-Engineering-Helper.run" command and remap the shortcut to your needs.
